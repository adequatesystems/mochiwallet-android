# Vite Configuration Patch - INFORMATIONAL ONLY
# 
# This patch file documents the change needed for Android WebView compatibility.
# The actual patching is performed automatically by build.ps1 via string replacement.
# 
# WHY THIS PATCH IS NEEDED:
# Chrome extensions use absolute paths (base: '/') which resolve to the root filesystem.
# Android WebView loads assets from file:///android_asset/ so paths must be relative (base: './').
# Without this change, all JS/CSS asset loads fail with 404 errors.
#
# HOW THE PATCH IS APPLIED:
# The build.ps1 script applies this patch during step 3 using PowerShell string replacement:
#   $viteContent = $viteContent -replace "base: '/'", "base: './'"
# This modifies mochiwallet/vite.config.ts before the extension is rebuilt.
#
# The diff below shows the exact change for reference:
